Overall, Lab 1 is complete, with minor changes. Project Scope might be a little too big, please cut down if you dont have
enough time to implement.

Functional Requirements: 
1. Form Validation requirements can be written in the Use Case Description/Data Dictionary (Optional)
2. Navigation Bar is not needed in the FRs (This can be viewed in UI Mockup)
3. Route Search Bar some functionalities might be difficult to implement
4. Example 1.6.3 As the page is part of the system, might be good to just say the system should display Current Friend List

Non-Functional Requirements: 
1. When mentioning compatability with IOS and Android, good to mention the Software or OS version numbers
2. Usability sounds like FR, Usability should state things for UI/UX helping users to do things in 5 clicks etc.
3. Security part sounds weird, users must be authenticated when logging in. 
All users must be authenticated before performing any actions?


Data Dictionary: 
Correct, No comments

Initial Use Case Diagram: 
1. Navigation bubbles not needed since Navigation FRs are not needed
2. Use Case Bubbles should always start with a verb, for example, UserRegistration -> Register Account
3. FriendsData and UserData is part of the system, therefore, not needed as actors
4. RouteData is a an API, mention API name

Use Case Description: 
No Comments. Well done 

UI Mockup:
All UIs match FRs
